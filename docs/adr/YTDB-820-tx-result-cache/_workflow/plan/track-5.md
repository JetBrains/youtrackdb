# Track 5: Aggregate delta — AGGREGATE_* shapes

## Purpose / Big Picture

BLUF: After this track, cached aggregate queries (`COUNT(*)`, `SUM(prop)`, `AVG(prop)`, `MIN(prop)`, `MAX(prop)`) reflect intra-tx mutations via per-query `AggregateState` copy-and-replay. Same applyMutation algorithm as eager, driven from delta-build instead of mutation-time dispatch.

Extend `ShapeClassifier` to return `AGGREGATE_COUNT`/`SUM`/`AVG`/`MIN`/`MAX` for single-aggregate SELECT shapes. Add `AggregateCacheTapStep` and splice into the execution plan upstream of `AggregateProjectionCalculationStep` during cache-miss execution. Implement `DeltaBuilder.buildForAggregate` that copies the entry's aggregate state and replays `applyMutation` over relevant tx-mutations. Extend `CachedResultSetView` to carry per-view `deltaAggregateState` and return `deltaState.toResult()` directly.

## Context and Orientation

**Codebase state at track start.** After Track 4: RECORD-shape delta works end-to-end. This track adds aggregate cacheability + delta replay using the same DeltaBuilder pattern.

Existing relevant code:
- `AggregateProjectionCalculationStep.java:121-137` — blocking aggregation loop: `prev.start(ctx)` then `while lastRs.hasNext: aggregate(lastRs.next, ctx, ...)`. Splice target for `AggregateCacheTapStep`.
- `AbstractExecutionStep` — base class for execution steps; provides `getPrev()` link traversal.
- `InternalExecutionPlan.steps` — list of execution steps; walked to find the aggregate step for splice.

**Concrete deliverables.**
- `ShapeClassifier.classify` extended: single-aggregate-projection SELECT returns one of `AGGREGATE_COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX`. Multi-aggregate, expression-aggregate (`SUM(a+b)`), aggregate-in-where, GROUP BY, HAVING, `COUNT DISTINCT`, `MEDIAN`/`MODE`/`PERCENTILE` → NONE.
- `AggregateState` complete with `observe(result)` (called by tap), `applyMutation(rec, status, matchAfter)` (called by DeltaBuilder), `copy()` (called by DeltaBuilder at view ctor), `toResult()` (called by view.next).
- `AggregateCacheTapStep extends AbstractExecutionStep` — side-tap step. `internalStart(ctx)` calls `getPrev().start(ctx)` to get upstream stream, then returns wrapping stream whose `next(ctx)` calls `entry.aggregateState.observe(result)` before forwarding unchanged.
- Plan-rewrite splice in `DatabaseSessionEmbedded.query()` miss path: walk `plan.steps`, find `AggregateProjectionCalculationStep`, rewire its `prev` to a new `AggregateCacheTapStep` whose `prev` is the original upstream. Failure to find expected shape → entry shape = NONE (downgrade).
- `DeltaBuilder.buildForAggregate(entry, recordOps, ctx) → AggregateState`: `entry.aggregateState.copy()` then iterate recordOps, class filter, WHERE eval, `deltaState.applyMutation(rec, status, match_after)`. Returns the delta-applied copy.
- `CachedResultSetView` extended: for aggregate shape, carry `deltaAggregateState` instead of `TxDeltaCursor`. `next()` returns `deltaAggregateState.toResult()` once; `hasNext()` true exactly once.

## Plan of Work

1. `AggregateState.observe(result)` — for COUNT(*): `contributingRids.add(rec.rid); count++`. For SUM/AVG: same + `contributingValues.put(rid, value); currentScalar += value`. For MIN/MAX: same + track `extremumRid` by RID identity. RID identity (not `Number.equals`) sidesteps the cross-Number-subtype hazard (`Long.valueOf(5L).equals(Integer.valueOf(5))` returns `false` in Java), and gives ties unambiguous semantics — one RID owns the slot at any time; the next ties-recompute picks whichever survives.
2. `AggregateState.applyMutation(rec, status, matchAfter)` — transition matrix per design.md §"Aggregate delta — AGGREGATE_* shapes":
   - COUNT: T→T no-op, F→F no-op, T→F decrement + remove from rids, F→T increment + add.
   - SUM/AVG: same matrix, with `delta = new_value - old_value` for T→T and full add/subtract for F→T / T→F.
   - MIN/MAX: same matrix, with O(n) recompute over `contributingValues` if `was_extremum` and new state loses the extremum direction. Where `was_extremum = rid.equals(extremumRid)` — RID identity.
3. `AggregateState.copy()` — shallow-deep: new mutable containers (`new HashSet<>(contributingRids)`, `new HashMap<>(contributingValues)`) but reuse underlying RID and Number refs.
4. `AggregateCacheTapStep` — implement as transparent side-tap. Tests: tap observes every record that reaches the aggregate step; tap doesn't change downstream result.
5. Plan-rewrite splice — implement in `DatabaseSessionEmbedded.query()` miss path. Failure case: planner emits unexpected shape (no AggregateProjectionCalculationStep found) → log warning, mark entry shape=NONE, skip caching.
6. `DeltaBuilder.buildForAggregate` — copy-then-replay.
7. View extension — `CachedResultSetView` handles aggregate shape: single-row read of `deltaAggregateState.toResult()`.
8. Test matrix (T5 set):
   - T5a: COUNT(*) — CREATE matching/non-matching, UPDATE in/out of WHERE, DELETE matching.
   - T5b: SUM(prop) — same matrix + UPDATE changing prop value (T→T with delta).
   - T5c: AVG(prop) — same as SUM + count tracking.
   - T5d: MIN(prop) — UPDATE extremum to non-extremum value triggers O(n) recompute. UPDATE non-extremum (no recompute).
   - T5e: MAX(prop) — symmetric to MIN.
   - T5f: Aggregate expression (`SUM(a+b)`) — classify returns NONE; not cached.
   - T5g: GROUP BY — NONE.
   - T5h: Plan-rewrite splice failure — verify entry downgraded to NONE shape, no NPE, no caching.
   - T5i (I4 aggregate): aggregate result equivalent to fresh execution post-mutation.

**Invariants to preserve.** I4: view output equals fresh execution composed with tx-delta. I7: deltaAggregateState immutable post-construction (cache `entry.aggregateState` is the immutable source; `copy()` produces the view's mutable working copy).

**Out-of-scope files.**
- `MATCH` classify and projector — Track 6.

**Inter-track dependencies.**
- Depends on: Track 4 (RECORD shape + DeltaBuilder + view sorted-merge).
- Unblocks: Track 6 (MATCH Etap A also extends ShapeClassifier and uses DeltaBuilder).

**Library / function signatures.**
- `AggregateState.observe(Result) → void`.
- `AggregateState.applyMutation(RecordAbstract, byte, boolean) → void`.
